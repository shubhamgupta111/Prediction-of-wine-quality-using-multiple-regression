# Prediction-of-wine-quality-using-multiple-regression
In this projecct I have predicted the wine quality using multiple regression in a simple way

Requirements-
1. import pandas2
2. import numpy
3. import sklearn

Here I have used Jupyter notebook console but you can use the any console.
I hope no doubts will raise in your mind while implementing the code.
Happy coding
